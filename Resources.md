Lesson 7 - Recurrent Neural Network
Lesson 8 - Sentiment Prediction RNN
This course is like an extended version of our lecture 2 - Neural Networks in PyTorch, and the above lessons might be a good way to familiarise with NLP using PyTorch

### XLNet

### BERT
The following kaggle kernels might be a good starting point!
